# Space Invaders Remastered
This program represents the remastered version of Space Invaders. This remastered version allows one to play a game that is similar to the original Space Invaders, in which enemy spaceships attempt to defeat the player through successive stages that become increasingly difficult.

## Implementation
This software was implemented by utilizing Javascript and the code.org editor. This program was implemented using fairly basic and elementary animations, and it also depends on on-event functions. The artificial intelligence is basic and does not actively hunt down the player.

## Prerequisites
Because this program was developed by utilizing code.org's game engine, it can only be played on the website code.org.
